* General

yas, is by far the most important plugin I use. snippets are crucial to maintaining sanity with all the technologies out there.

* enabling and configuration

This enables yas throughout global mode, this is awesome, but can be annoying sometimes.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(require 'yasnippet)
(yas-global-mode 1)
#+end_src

This makes sure it sees the different snippets directories I have on the file system.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq yas-snippet-dirs
      '("~/.emacs.d/snippets"   ;; personal snippets
        "~/.emacs.d/elpa/yasnippet-20141223.303/snippets" ;; melpa install
        ))

(add-to-list 'load-path
             "~/.emacs.d/elpa/yasnippet-20141223.303/snippets")
#+end_src

* chef-mode

Because of the snippets being tied to chef-mode instead of ruby-mode, I have to create a "fake" minor mode called chef-mode so yas knows when to enable the snippets.

As you can see, it just enables it whenever ruby-mode is enabled also.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(define-minor-mode chef-mode
  "This is to activate the chef-mode for yasnippets"
  :lighter " chef-mode")

;; When entering ruby-mode, consider also the snippets in the
;; snippet table "chef-mode"
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook
          #'(lambda ()
              (yas-activate-extra-mode 'chef-mode)))
#+end_src
