* git-gutter mode

Make sure that [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-git-gutter][git-gutter]] is setup for ruby-mode

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'git-gutter-mode)
#+end_src

Some random variables and such that I like.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
